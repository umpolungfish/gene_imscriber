"""
chimera.py — Tensor Product Risk for Multi-Primitive Edits.

The Chimera Theorem: composite risk of multi-primitive edits is TENSORIAL,
not additive. Two independently tolerable edits at different primitive classes
can produce a trap state (Ç_⊛) when combined.

Key dangerous pairs:
  Ħ⊗Ð, Ħ⊗Ω, Ð⊗Ω → ALWAYS trap (critical×critical)
  Ř⊗Ħ, Ř⊗Ð, Ř⊗Ω, φ̂⊗Ħ, φ̂⊗Ř → trap (high×critical/high)
  Þ⊗Ř, Φ⊗φ̂, Ç⊗Ħ, Γ⊗Ř → semi-trap (moderate×critical/high)
